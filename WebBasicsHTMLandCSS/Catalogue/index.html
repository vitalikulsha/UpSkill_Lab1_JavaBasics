				<h3>Description:</h3>
				<p class="grey-text">
				The legendary author Bruce Eckel brings Java to life with this extraordinarily insightful, 
				opinionated and downright funny introduction. Thinking in Java introduces all of the 
				language's fundamentals, one step at a time, using to-the-point code examples. More than 
				virtually any other book, Thinking in Java helps you understand not just what to do -- but 
				why. Eckel introduces all the basics of objects as Java uses them; then walks carefully 
				through the fundamental concepts underlying all Java programming -- including program flow, 
				initialization and cleanup, hiding implementations, reusing classes and polymorphism. Using 
				extensive, to-the-point examples, he introduces error handling, exceptions, Java I/O, 
				run-time type identification, and passing and returning objects. He covers the Java AWT, 
				multithreading, network programming with Java -- even design patterns. The best way to 
				understand the real value of this book is to hear what readers of the online version have 
				been saying about it: "much better than any other Java book I've seen, by an order of 
				magnitude..." "mature, consistent, intellectually honest, well-written and precise..." "a 
				thoughtful, penetrating analytical tutorial which doesn't kowtow to the manufacturers..." "
				Thank you again for your awesome book. I was really floundering, but your book has brought 
				me up to speed as quickly as I could read it!"For both beginner and experienced C and C++ 
				programmers who want to learn Java.

				<h3>Description:</h3>
				<p class="grey-text">
				Tired of reading HTML books that only make sense after you're an expert? 
				Then it's about time you picked up Head First HTML with CSS & XHTML and 
				really learned HTML. You want to learn HTML so you can finally create 
				those Web pages you've always wanted, so you can communicate more effectively 
				with friends, family, fans and fanatic customers. You also want to do it 
				right so you can actually maintain and expand your Web pages over time, and 
				so your Web pages work in all the browsers and mobile devices out there. Oh, 
				and if you've never heard of CSS, that's okay - we won't tell anyone you're 
				still partying like it's 1999 - but if you're going to create Web pages in 
				the 21st century then you'll want to know and understand CSS.<br>
				Learn the real secrets of creating Web pages, and why everything your boss 
				told you about HTML tables is probably wrong (and what to do instead). Most 
				importantly, hold your own with your co-worker (and impress cocktail party 
				guests) when he casually mentions how his HTML is now strict, and his CSS 
				is in an external style sheet.<br>
				With Head First HTML with CSS & XHTML, you'll avoid the embarrassment of 
				thinking Web-safe colors still matter, and the foolishness of slipping a 
				font tag into your pages. Best of all, you'll learn HTML and CSS in a way 
				that won't put you to sleep. If you've read a Head First book, you know 
				what to expect: a visually-rich format designed for the way your brain 
				works. Using the latest research in neurobiology, cognitive science, and 
				learning theory, this book will load HTML, CSS, and XHTML into your brain 
				in a way that sticks.
